Charlie Lee Reflection

### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't really struggling with any concepts that I knew of, but I hadn't looked at merge conflicts so that was new during this session and that took a few minutes to understand.  I am also curious how the workflow will occur with an actual development team.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Merge conflicts make more sense now, and how you can delete the feature branch (conflict included) after resolving the conflict in the master.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked questions about merge conflicts and git's automatic branch naming conventions.

### What still confuses you about git?

Apparently git saves a copy of the remote master branch on your local machine, so it can do comparisons. I'm not sure if that's accurate, but I'll look into it to make sure I understand exactly what 'origin/master' represents on my local machine.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I liked breaking the roles in driver and navigator, and having the guide there to answer questions. It made it easier than researchign questions on my own, but I do still have some points I should review to make sure I fully understand them.
