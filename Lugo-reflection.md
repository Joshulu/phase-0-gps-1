What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I didn't feel like I was struggling with any of them in particular.  I did learn a couple new things though.  

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Pretty much everything was clarified.  Resolidifying pull requests, fetch and merge, the difference between master and origin/master, and merge conflicts

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Asked about formating for commands not commonly used and about best practices.

What still confuses you about git?

The way git resolves and evaluates merge conflicts seems a little vague (at least the way it was explained to me)

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was interesting.  It felt more pressured than a peer pairing, but it provided good confidence in skills we learned last week (and continue to use).  The way I understand it, future GPS will feel different, based on the type of assignment that this one is and how future ones will be more code based/building things.
